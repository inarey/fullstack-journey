# My Daily Learning Log â€“ Started July End Goal in 12 weeks(September 30, 2025) Web Dev Journey

This repository contains the code and notes from my daily learning sessions as I work toward becoming a freelance full-stack developer.

## JavaScript Review
- Arrays 
  - push() // will push value to the end of the array
  - includes()  //returns boolean if anything is inside/included in the array
  - forEach()  // forEach will iterate over an array and log each array
  - map() condition will run through the variable and execute condition then return a new array with the new result
  - some() //sort if at least any in the array answers the condition in the return statement
  - find() // to look for something inside the variable and actually return that something
  - filter() //this will return a new array as a result from the condition
